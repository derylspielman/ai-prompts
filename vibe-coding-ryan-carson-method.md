# Ryan Carson's 3-Step AI Coding Workflow Prompt

This guide outlines a structured approach to leverage AI tools for efficient product development, even without a large engineering team.

---

## Step 1: Generate a Structured Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Prompt:**

> "I am developing a [brief description of your product or feature]. Please help me create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that includes:
> 
> - A clear problem statement
> - User personas
> - Key features and functionalities
> - User flows
> - Technical constraints and considerations
> - Success metrics
> 
> Feel free to ask any clarifying questions to ensure the PRD is well-defined."

---

## Step 2: Generate a Detailed Task List from the PRD

**Prompt:**

> "Based on the PRD we've developed, please create a detailed, step-by-step task list to guide the development process. Each task should be actionable and include checkboxes for tracking progress. Organize the tasks logically, and ensure they cover all aspects from setup to deployment."

---

## Step 3: Systematically Work Through Each Task

**Prompt:**

> "Let's begin executing the tasks one by one. Starting with the first task: [insert first task here]. Please provide the necessary code, configurations, or guidance to complete this task. After completing each task, I will mark it as done, and we can proceed to the next one. Ensure that each step maintains context from the previous ones."

## Additional Considerations

- **Provide Ample Context**: Ensure you supply the AI with all relevant information about your project to facilitate accurate and context-aware assistance.

- **Use a Consistent AI Model**: Stick with one AI tool throughout the process to maintain continuity and leverage its strengths effectively.

- **Maintain Human Oversight**: Regularly review the AI's output to correct any errors and ensure alignment with your vision.

- **Start Small and Iterate**: Begin with a simple version of your product and refine it progressively, allowing for manageable development and easier troubleshooting.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively leverage AI to build your product efficiently, even without a large engineering team.
