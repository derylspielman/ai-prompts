Ryan Carson's method for "vibe coding" with AI, which he describes as a way to build products quickly and efficiently, involves these 3 main steps:

*1. Create a structured product requirement document
:*
Use an AI tool like ChatGPT or ChatPRD to generate a PRD. 
Provide the AI with the necessary context about your product and the specific feature you want to build. 
Answer any clarifying questions the AI might ask to ensure a well-defined PRD. (3:25)

2. Generate a detailed task list from the PRD:
Use an AI tool like Cursor to generate a task list based on the PRD. 
Instruct the AI to create a step-by-step list with checkboxes for easy tracking. 
Optional: Use tools like Task Master to manage the task list in a more sophisticated way. (11:00)

3. Work through the tasks systematically:
Use the AI to help you complete each subtask one at a time. 
Mark tasks as complete as you finish them. 
Wait for user input before proceeding to the next task. 
Regularly review the app's state and commit changes frequently. (18:07)

Important Considerations:

Provide ample context: Don't rush the process. Make sure the AI has all the information it needs to understand your requirements. (0:02, 15:31)
Use a consistent AI model: Choose a model you're familiar with and know its strengths and weaknesses. (12:47)
Maintain a human in the loop: Don't rely solely on the AI. Regularly check its output and fix any errors or issues. (20:19)
Start small and iterate:  Begin with simple projects and gradually refine your workflow as you gain experience. (21:35)

By following these steps, you can leverage the power of AI to build products more efficiently, even without a large engineering team. (26:45)
